This a windows desktop app for tracking writing progress against the length of a project. It's written using C++ in Qt6 Widgets. I intend it to be free for use, for anyone, for any purpose, except commercial. If you want to tinker with the raw files, be my guest. But it is my intention to leave it as light weight, and as distraction free as possible. If you want to write, with clear goals and stats, this app is for you. If you want something game-ified, it's not. But it could be your base if you like to code and write like I do.

Note: WriteTracker is currently unsigned. Windows SmartScreen or antivirus software may show a warning when you run the app.
This does not mean the app is unsafe — it’s just a result of being unsigned.
To run the app:
Click “More info” if prompted.
Then select “Run anyway.”
